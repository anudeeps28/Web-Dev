 For the first few lectures, we are going to use Console in the web browser, although while making proper projects we can write our code in VS code or any other code editor just like we do for HTML and CSS files.

Console uses **REPL (Read - Evaluate - Print - Loop)**. This is just like using the command line/terminal.
