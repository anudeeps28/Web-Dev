When designing a website, begin by mapping out its overall layout and breaking it into distinct containers (divs) using the intuitive CSS box model. 

Decompose your design into its smallest components, build each piece from the ground up, and then assemble them into larger structures

Always focus on the smallest unit of development and work your way upward.
